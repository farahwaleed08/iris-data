The aim of this project was to classify Iris flowers into different species based on their features. Using the Iris flower dataset, I applied various machine learning algorithms to analyze the data. The project covered data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization. I experimented with multiple models to identify the one with the highest accuracy for flower classification.
